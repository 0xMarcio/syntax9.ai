summary: "Combining passive DNS, CT logs, and LLM heuristics to surface unknown internet exposure."

## Overview

Shadow assets drive incidents: forgotten subdomains, orphaned buckets, and debug endpoints. We fuse passive DNS,
certificate transparency, WHOIS, and vendor APIs, then enlist a small LLM to group and rank candidates by ownership
likelihood.

### Method

- Seed from apex + historical CN/SANs, expand via passive DNS and NS glue.
- Normalize by registrant, ASN, and banner signatures; dedupe by Jaccard on token sets.
- LLM scoring on short metadata tuples (no secrets) to prioritize probable matches.

### Findings

Across three orgs, mean unknowns dropped by 41% with two hours of analyst time. False positives were dominated by
vendor shared infra—mitigated by a simple ASN denylist and PTR heuristics.

### Mitigations

Automate rechecks weekly; alert on ownership drift (WHOIS/CT deltas) and sudden banner change.

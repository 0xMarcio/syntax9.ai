summary: "From single prompts to evolving chains: pressure‑testing agent loops and tool use."

## Approach

We move beyond one‑shot jailbreaks to chain‑level attacks: perturb memory, tool arguments, and intermediate state. A
driver generates counterfactual steps, while a critic labels success.

### Scenario set

- Spec‑confusion on tool schema → silent parameter injection.
- Memory splice → instruction smuggling after “safe” steps.
- Guardrail drift → refusal‑bypass after reflective edits.

### Outcome

Chain coverage increased 3×, finding issues that single‑turn eval missed. Best defense was signed tool use + argument
schemas with strict validation.

title: Detecting lateral movement in serverless estates
tag: Detection
date: 2025-06-12
summary: "Signal fusion across IAM, runtime, and network to catch stealthy pivots without agents."
---

## Signals

- IAM: unusual role assumption chain depth and rare action combos.
- Runtime: coldâ€‘start anomalies + extended network egress to new ASNs.
- Network: DNS entropy spikes tied to short TTLs.

### Detection sketch

```
score = w1*rare(iam.actions) + w2*net.new_asn + w3*dns.entropy
if score > T: raise('suspected lateral move')
```

We validated on replayed incidents; precision improved after whitelisting CI/CD identities.

## Field notes

Most successful attacks combined credential reuse with real‑time prompts. Push fatigue remains effective against broad
populations.

### Mitigations

- Number‑matching or FIDO2 where possible.
- Velocity limits on push prompts + user‑initiated challenge only.
- Per‑app conditional access with device posture checks.

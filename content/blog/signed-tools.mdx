## Why sign?

Tool calls are the blast radius. We sign the schema + arguments and verify at the runtime boundary, rejecting drifted
or unapproved invocations.

### Pattern

```javascript
const signature = sign(tool_id + args + nonce, key)
if (!verify(signature)) throw new Error('invalid signature')
execute(tool_id, allowlist(args))
```

Pairs well with strict JSON schemas and minimal capability tokens.

title: Abusing retrieval pipelines to exfiltrate secrets

## The problem

RAG systems often trust retrieved chunks implicitly. Attackers coerce retrieval with crafted queries then steer
summarization to leak sensitive spans.

### Hardening steps

1. Classification gate on query intent and chunk sensitivity (cheap model).
2. Redact at chunk load with deterministic policies (regex + DLP), not at response time.
3. Signed tool calls; trace verdicts alongside answers for audit.
